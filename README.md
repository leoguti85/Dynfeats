# Multiscale Assortativities for Graph Classification

This repository provides sources of the method proposed in the paper:
Multiscale Assortativities for Graph Classification. For further information, please check the scripts header.

This is a feature based method for creating graph feature vectors for classification purposes. More details can be found in the [website](http://sites.uclouvain.be/big-data/Downloads/Dynfeats).

Dynamics Based Features for Graph Classification is a previous arxiv version of this updated paper.

Scripts for svm are available in Matlab. The Random Forest version is in Python.
